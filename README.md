## ‚ú® Introduction

This project is a personal milestone achieved after completing my deep dive into Hibernate ORM. It demonstrates a full-fledged relational system where:
- Authors write Books
- Books belong to multiple Libraries (many-to-many)
- Hibernate manages all entities with bi-directional associations, lazy loading, and caching

I built this to solidify my understanding of entity relationships, session management, and query execution using HQL.
